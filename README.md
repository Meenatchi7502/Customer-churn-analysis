# Customer-churn-analysis
Project Goals:
Your primary responsibility is to investigate the reasons behind customer attrition within a defined timeframe. Develop a dashboard using the provided data to present insights that can guide business decisions. Share key findings and recommendations derived from the analysis to empower decision-makers in addressing customer churn effectively.

My Analysis:

The total number of Customers is 7043,
Customer Churn Rate 1,869 customers, which is approximately 26.54%.
The total number of Churn Customers is 1859
Tech-related tickets: 2,955
Admin-related tickets: 3,622
Total charges: $1,605,168

Electronic checks are the preferred payment method, surpassing credit cards. 
Senior citizens with male partners exhibit higher churn rates. Customers with no partners 51.7% are more likely to churn. Also, Fiber optic subscribers have a higher churn rate of 43.96% which may be due to high charges per month. 
Customers without certain contract types or additional services are more prone to churn.
Paperless billing is a preferred option for many customers.
Here I used Gauge Chart for predicting the churn rate for future periods based on historical data.
High volumes of tech and admin tickets were opened, indicating areas for improvement in service quality and customer support.

Recommendations:
•	Highlight the perks of paperless billing to encourage its adoption.
•	Ensure electronic check payments are seamless and secure for customer peace of mind.
•	Increase technical support customers device protection to ensure prompt issue resolution 
•	We have more customers using Electronic Check, but we have more non-Churn Customers using Credit Card, so we should embed some of the Electronic Check packages into the Credit card Package.
•	Encourage customers to consider longer-term contracts with incentives or discounts, especially for Month-to-Month subscribers.
•	Senior citizens are churning at a higher rate. Develop tailored services and support for this segment.
•	Customers with lower tenure (0-20 range) are churning at a higher rate. Implement retention strategies for this group.
